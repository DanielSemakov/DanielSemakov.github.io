                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Homepage - Yes, the submission leads right to the page to be reviewed. The main page is inside project/index.html.</li>
                    <li>Spaces / upper-cases in file / folder names - No spaces or uppercase in the file, folder, or image names.</li>
                    <li>Design
                        <ul>
                            <li>Contrast/ font sizing - The "Home" and "Nails" page contain black text on a gray background, making it a bit difficult to read.
                                Furthermore, the captions on the "Nails" page could be made bigger for better visibility.
                            </li>
                            <li>Color and font - Yes, project has site colors and fonts using css file.</li>
                            <li>CRAP:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Contrast - The text doesn't properly contrast with its background, such as in the "Nails" page, as stated earlier.</li>
                                    <li>Repetition - Website has a consistent color scheme of dark red, white, gray, and black. The header is consistently on
                                        the left side of the website.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Alignment - The navigation bar is misaligned such that the "Contact" page is half out-of-view. Besides this,
                                        the images and captions on all the pages are well aligned, horizontally and vertically.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Proximity - The proximity of elements is great. There is just enough space between images in the photo gallery
                                        to be able to display many of the images at once while looking visually pleasing. But, again, the nav bar should
                                        be moved up so that the "Contact" page can be fully seen and selected.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Page Has:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Header - A header is visually displayed on every page, but the HTML code for it is 
                                not placed in &lt;header&gt; tags, as it should be.
                            </li>
                            <li>Main - There's no main on any of the pages.</li>
                            <li>Footer - Yes, there's a footer for every page.</li>
                            <li>Nav - Yes, there's a nav for all pages.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Header with site/brand and h1 - Again, there's no formally-assigned header. In the de facto
                        header, there's an image with the brand name but no &lt;h1&gt; tag with it.
                    </li>
                    <li>Main with h2 - There's no main on any site nor any h2 with the page name.
                    </li>
                    <li>Brand tagline - The home page has tagline "Professional Makeup and Nail Artist" but it only
                        appears on this page.
                    </li>
                    <li>Footer with user pages - Footer has menu for user's pages and html and css validation links that work.</li>
                    <li>Specific requirements:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Website has six pages, meeting the requirement of at least 5.</li>
                            <li>Website has an interactive photo galleries.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </section>
        </main>
        <footer>
            <div data-include="components/footer.html"></div>
        </footer>
        <script src="scripts/menuLoader.js"></script>
