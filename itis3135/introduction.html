                <p>I was born in Charlotte, NC, moved to California at the age of 5, then returned to Charlotte at 18 years old.
                    I am currently 22 years old. I am currently
                    getting a Computer Science major with a specialization in Software Engineering at UNC Charlotte and I plan
                    to graduate in Spring 2025. My hobbies include playing chess, writing, and programming. I have been eagerly
                    watching the World Chess Championship and rooting for Gukesh to win it all.
