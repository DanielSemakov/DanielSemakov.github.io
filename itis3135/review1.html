            <ol>
                <li>Homepage - Yes, the submission leads right to the page to be reviewed. The main page is inside project/index.html.</li>
                <li>Spaces / upper-cases in file / folder names - No spaces or uppercase in the file, folder, or image names.</li>
                <li>Design
                    <ul>
                    <li>Contrast/ font sizing - Text contrasts well against background. The small font above or below the large images is a bit
                        jarring. Maybe make the font larger.
                    </li>
                    <li>Color and font - Yes, project has site colors and fonts using css file.</li>
                    <li>CRAP:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Contrast - The text contrasts with the background. The font color is either white against a black background or black and grey against a white background.</li>
                            <li>Repetition - Website has a consistent color scheme of white, grey, and black. However, the image on the "About Us" page 
                                is smaller than those on the "Home," "Services," and "News" page.
                            </li>
                            <li>Alignment - Most of the website is aligned well. The nav bar is below h1 and the text and images are vertically aligned.
                                However, all text is center-aligned, which looks a bit awkward for the contact form. Perhaps make all the labels and inputs left-aligned for the form.
                            </li>
                            <li>Proximity - Add margin below the header and above the footer to make the site less cluttered. Also, add a larger vertical margin between
                                different article on the "News" page.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul></li>
    
                <li>Page Has:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Header - Yes for all pages</li>
                        <li>Main - Yes for all pages</li>
                        <li>Footer - Yes for all pages</li>
                        <li>Nav - Yes for all pages</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <li>Header with site/brand and h1 - Each page has a fitting header with an h1 element that contains the company name.</li>
                    <li>Main with h2 - Main starts with the name of the page in h2, but h2 also contains the name of the company on multiple
                        pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>Brand tagline - The site does contain any brand tagline.</li>
                    <li>Footer with user pages - The "Alex Innovations" link doesn't work. Footer has html and css validation links that work.</li>
                    <li>Specific requirements:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Website has required five pages.</li>
                            <li>Website has an interactive photo gallery and contact form.</li>
                        </ul>
            </ol>
